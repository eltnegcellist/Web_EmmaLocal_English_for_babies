/**
 * Voice dialogs: the one-call way to build a speech interface.
 *
 * ```ts
 * const agent = new AgentFlow();
 *
 * agent.listenFor('set up wifi', async (d) => {
 *   const ssid = await d.ask("What's the name of your wifi network?");
 *   if (await d.confirm(`I heard ${ssid}. Is that right?`)) {
 *     await d.say(`Done. Connecting to ${ssid}.`);
 *   }
 * });
 *
 * await agent.load();
 * await agent.startListening();
 * ```
 *
 * `load()` downloads and wires everything a voice interface needs: a streaming
 * speech-to-text model, an embedding model for matching trigger phrases, a
 * text-to-speech voice, and a microphone. `speech(false)` and
 * `microphone(false)` each drop one of those when an application does not need
 * it. A flow is an ordinary async function, so it reads top to bottom and
 * `try` / `finally` work the way you expect.
 *
 * Scope note vs. the Python runner: this port implements free-form asks plus
 * confirm/choose matching. The alphanumeric dictation subsystem and the
 * success/error beep diagnostics are not here yet.
